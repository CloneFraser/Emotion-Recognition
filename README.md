# Emotion-Recognition
This repository contains the code for the Emotion Recognition software that I individually developed as part of my 4th-year MEng Group Project.

Project Overview
The MEng Group Project involved creating a collaborative product, with each team member responsible for developing their own sub-system. Our group worked on the CommuniTech Wall, a project where we combined our individual components to build a cohesive system. This repository specifically focuses on the emotion recognition sub-system that I developed.

My final technical report can be found under file name Technical Report PDF.
